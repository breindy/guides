## What Is an Api

API stands for Application Programming Interface. Don’t worry about the AP, just focus on the I. An API is an interface. You use interfaces all the time. A computer operating system is an interface. Buttons in an elevator are an interface. A gas pedal in a car is an interface.

An interface sits on top of a complicated system and simplifies certain tasks, a middleman that saves you from needing to know all the details of what’s happening under the hood. A web API is the same sort of thing. It sits on top of a web service, like Twitter or YouTube, and simplifies certain tasks for you. It translates your actions into the technical details for the computer system on the other end.

## How to get started:
The best way to get started is to find an API that interests you and just start doing it! 
There is almost an API for every technology out there. Everyone is constantly sharing data with one another that can be useful integration for another person's future application!

For example, take Google Maps. With a Google Maps API, a program can give accurate directions to a place of their choice without hardcoding their own Maps technology to provide that.

The key to API success is the documentation of the API itself. In order to get the gist of things involving API, reading a documentation with useful notations, developer support, and great examples can help you integrate or understand the technology of a company's API better.
